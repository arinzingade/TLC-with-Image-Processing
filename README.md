## Helps in Detecting RF Values from TLC plates.

In chemistry laboratory work, analyzing Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) plates is a critical task for identifying the compounds present in a solution. This process can often be redundant and time-consuming for chemists, typically taking up to 100 minutes.

To address this challenge, I have developed an advanced tool designed to significantly streamline TLC analysis. This tool reduces the time required to analyze TLC plates from 100 minutes to just a few milliseconds, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in the laboratory.
